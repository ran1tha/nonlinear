Analysis of the Stability in Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations

In this short discussion we will analyze the stability of nonlinear ordinary differential equations
(ODEs). First, there will be a brief introduction to nonlinear systems. Next, the definition of
stability will be investigated. Subsequently, we will analyze the stability of nonlinear systems
with the help of mathematical tools such as, linearization in the vicinity of equilibrium points,
Lyapunov’s stability theorem ~and Chetaev’s instability theorem~. Finally, we will study a nonlinear
system with the help of a numerical simulation.
